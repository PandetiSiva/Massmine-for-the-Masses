# Massmine-for-the-Masses
Description of the project

Massmine-for-the-Masses is an open-source, proof of concept tool. It extends the functionality of the big data gathering tool Massmine which is a command-line interface. Massmine-for-the-Masses has a graphical user interface that allows users to see data being collected and view it in real-time, from social media platforms and Wikipedia as well. The data will also be presented in a simple user interface to allow for basic analysis without the user ever having to directly interact with it. This is an improvement of the existing project(https://github.com/JoshCMoore/Massmine-for-the-Masses and https://github.com/gowthamichinta/Massmine-for-the-Masses.git) where all the web pages are redesigned to enhance the user experience and offer smooth navigation throughout its design.
